# Architecture

Design decisions, dependency graph, and structural overview of the landing-zone infrastructure.

## Design Rationale

### Why OpenTofu (not Terraform)

OpenTofu is the open-source fork of Terraform, free from licensing restrictions. The codebase requires `>= 1.11.0` and uses native S3 state locking (`use_lockfile`), removing the need for a DynamoDB lock table.

### Why Terragrunt

Terragrunt provides DRY environment management on top of OpenTofu:
- **Single provider/backend config** -- the root `terragrunt.hcl` generates the cloud-specific `provider.tf` and `backend.tf` for every component
- **Dependency orchestration** -- `dependency` blocks in `_envcommon/{cloud}/` wire outputs between components without hardcoding
- **Environment parity** -- same components, different inputs per environment
- **Multi-cloud dispatch** -- a single root config conditionally generates the correct provider (AWS/GCP/Azure) and state backend (S3/GCS/Azure Blob)

### Why Components (not a Monolith)

Each component has independent state, independent plan/apply, and independent blast radius. A failed `gateway` apply does not block `observability`. Components can be deployed in parallel where dependencies allow.

### Why Multi-Tenant via `for_each`

The `for_each` pattern over a `tenants` map gives each tenant isolated cloud resources while sharing the same OpenTofu module code. Adding a tenant is a map entry, not a new module call. Resources are named with the tenant key, making them easy to identify and delete. This pattern is currently used in 7 AWS components.

## Dependency Graph

The core dependency chain applies to all three clouds. AWS has additional workload-layer components.

### AWS (24 components)

  * = also depends on network (vpc_id, private_subnet_ids)

  Standalone (no dependencies):
  backup, break-glass, service-quotas, cost, dns

  Organization layer (management account only):
  org-identity, org-security, org-compliance
  org-cost, org-networking, org-scp
```

### GCP / Azure (17 components each)

### Dependency Details (AWS)

| Component | Depends On | Receives |
|-----------|-----------|----------|
| **network** | -- | -- |
| **cluster** | network | vpc_id, private_subnet_ids, public_subnet_ids |
| **cluster-addons** | cluster | cluster_name, oidc_provider_arn, oidc_issuer |
| **cluster-bootstrap** | cluster | cluster_name, cluster_endpoint, cluster_certificate_authority_data |
| **druid** | network, cluster | vpc_id, private_subnet_ids, cluster_sg_id, oidc_provider_arn, oidc_issuer |
| **pipeline** | network, cluster | vpc_id, private_subnet_ids, cluster_sg_id, oidc_provider_arn, oidc_issuer |
| **llm** | network, cluster | vpc_id, private_subnet_ids, cluster_sg_id, oidc_provider_arn, oidc_issuer |
| **gateway** | cluster | cluster_sg_id, oidc_provider_arn, oidc_issuer |
| **rag** | cluster | cluster_sg_id, oidc_provider_arn, oidc_issuer |
| **mlops** | cluster | cluster_sg_id, oidc_provider_arn, oidc_issuer |
| **governance** | cluster | cluster_sg_id, oidc_provider_arn, oidc_issuer |
| **observability** | cluster | cluster_name |
| **secrets** | cluster | oidc_provider_arn, oidc_issuer |
| **backup** | -- | -- |
| **break-glass** | -- | -- |
| **service-quotas** | -- | -- |
| **cost** | -- | -- |
| **dns** | -- | -- |

GCP and Azure follow the same `network -> cluster -> {cluster-addons, cluster-bootstrap, observability, secrets}` chain. Standalone components have no dependencies on any cloud.

## Layer Breakdown

### Organization Layer

Components deployed once in the management/org account to establish cross-account governance and shared infrastructure.

| Component | AWS | GCP | Azure |
|-----------|-----|-----|-------|
| **org-identity** | IAM Identity Center (SSO) -- permission sets, groups, account assignments | Cloud Identity groups, IAM bindings across projects | Entra ID groups, role assignments across subscriptions |
| **org-security** | GuardDuty (S3/EKS/malware/RDS/Lambda), Security Hub (CIS + AWS Foundational) | Security Command Center, Web Security Scanner | Defender for Cloud, Sentinel integration |
| **org-compliance** | Shared KMS, organization CloudTrail, AWS Config rules + conformance packs | Organization audit logging, Cloud Asset Inventory, access transparency logs | Azure Policy assignments, compliance dashboards, Activity Log export |
| **org-cost** | Organization budget, cost categories, anomaly detection, CUR 2.0 export | Billing budgets, BigQuery billing export, commitment analysis | Cost Management budgets, anomaly alerts, reservation recommendations |
| **org-networking** | Transit Gateway + RAM sharing, IPAM, Route53 Resolver rules | Shared VPC, VPC peering, Cloud DNS policies | Virtual WAN / Hub-Spoke, Azure DNS Private Resolver |
| **org-scp / org-policy** | Service Control Policies on OUs/accounts | Organization Policies (constraints on folders/projects) | Azure Policy definitions + initiatives on management groups |

### Network Layer

**Component:** `network`

Provisions the network foundation for each environment:

| Feature | AWS | GCP | Azure |
|---------|-----|-----|-------|
| Network | VPC with configurable CIDR | VPC network with subnets | VNet with configurable address space |
| Subnet tiers | public, private, intra (across AZs) | public, private (across zones) | public, private (across availability zones) |
| NAT | NAT gateways (1/2/3 by env) | Cloud NAT (1/2/3 by env) | NAT Gateway (1/2/3 by env) |
| Service access | VPC endpoints (optional) | Private Google Access, Private Service Connect | Service endpoints, Private Link |
| Flow logs | VPC flow logs (staging + prod) | VPC Flow Logs (staging + prod) | NSG flow logs (staging + prod) |

### Cluster Layer

**Components:** `cluster`, `cluster-bootstrap`, `cluster-addons`

| Feature | AWS | GCP | Azure |
|---------|-----|-----|-------|

|                                  |     |                              |
|  OpenTofu + Terragrunt           |     |  ArgoCD ApplicationSets     |

|  - Workload identity roles      |     |                              |
+----------------------------------+     +------------------------------+
              |                                       |
              |         cluster-bootstrap             |
              |<------- is the handoff point -------->|
              |                                       |
```

After `cluster-bootstrap` deploys Cilium and ArgoCD, ArgoCD watches the GitOps repo and reconciles all in-cluster resources.

## Security Model

### CI/CD Authentication

| Cloud | Mechanism | Details |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| AWS | OIDC federation | GitHub Actions assumes `AWS_ROLE_ARN` via OIDC -- no long-lived credentials. Trust policy scoped to the repository. |
| GCP | Workload Identity Federation | GitHub Actions exchanges OIDC token for short-lived GCP credentials via a Workload Identity Pool. No service account keys. |
| Azure | Federated Identity Credentials | GitHub Actions uses OIDC to authenticate as an app registration with federated credentials. No client secrets. |

Each environment has its own role/identity with a trust policy scoped to the repository.

### Pod Authentication (Workload Identity)

| Cloud | Mechanism | Module |
|-------|-----------|--------|
| AWS | IRSA (IAM Roles for Service Accounts) | `modules/aws/workload-identity/` |
| GCP | GKE Workload Identity (KSA-to-GSA binding) | `modules/gcp/workload-identity/` |
| Azure | AKS Workload Identity (federated credential on managed identity) | `modules/azure/workload-identity/` |

Each module creates a cloud IAM identity scoped to a specific Kubernetes namespace and service account. Multi-tenant AWS components create one IRSA role per tenant.

### Guardrails

| Cloud | Mechanism | Component |
|-------|-----------|-----------|
| AWS | Service Control Policies (SCPs) on OUs/accounts | `org-scp` |
| GCP | Organization Policy constraints on folders/projects | `org-policy` |
| Azure | Azure Policy definitions + initiatives on management groups | `org-policy` |

Guardrails prevent actions like disabling audit logging, leaving the organization, or using unapproved regions.

### Emergency Access

The `break-glass` component provisions emergency access roles per cloud:

| Cloud | Mechanism |
|-------|-----------|
| AWS | IAM roles with SNS alerts on assumption, configurable `max_session_duration` (default 1 hour) |
| GCP | Privileged Google service accounts with audit logging, time-bound access |
| Azure | PIM-eligible roles with approval workflows, time-bound activation |

### SSO / Identity

The `org-identity` component manages identity and access per cloud:

| Cloud | Mechanism |
|-------|-----------|
| AWS | IAM Identity Center -- 5 permission sets (Admin, PowerUser, ReadOnly, PlatformEngineer, Developer), groups, account assignments |
| GCP | Cloud Identity groups, project-level IAM bindings, custom roles |
| Azure | Entra ID groups, subscription-level role assignments, custom role definitions |

## State Management

| Cloud | Backend | Locking | Bucket/Container Naming | Init Script |
|-------|---------|---------|------------------------|-------------|
| AWS | S3 (versioned, AES-256 encrypted) | Native conditional writes (`use_lockfile`) | `{account_id}-{region}-tfstate` | `scripts/init-backend-aws.sh` |
| GCP | GCS (versioned) | Native GCS locking | `{project_id}-{region}-tfstate` | `scripts/init-backend-gcp.sh` |
| Azure | azurerm Blob (versioned) | Native blob leasing | `tfstate-rg` / `tfstate{sub_id_prefix}` | `scripts/init-backend-azure.sh` |

Key convention: `{environment}/{component}/terraform.tfstate` (AWS/Azure) or `{environment}/{component}/` prefix (GCP).

Each component in each environment has independent state, enabling parallel operations and isolated blast radius.

## Team Ownership

Based on `team` tags set in `_envcommon/{cloud}/` files:

| Team | Components |
|------|-----------|
| **platform** | network, cluster, cluster-addons, cluster-bootstrap, gateway*, dns, service-quotas, all org-* |
| **sre** | observability, backup |
| **security** | governance*, secrets, break-glass |
| **data-platform** | druid*, pipeline* |
| **ml-platform** | llm*, mlops*, rag* |
| **finops** | cost |

\* = AWS-only component
